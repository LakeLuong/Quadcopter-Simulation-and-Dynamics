I will be learning how to build a drone from scratch using my ongoing knowledge of material science, physics, and electronics. I will CAD the drone in Solidworks and then run an
FEA simulation on it to refine and adjust the drone, accounting for this such as the factor of safety and stiffness. Then, using my physics and some calculus, I will simulate 
the motion and integrate a PID controller using MATLAB. Finally, after gathering simulation data, I am currently learning how to create my own flight controller and PCB design 
through Hack Club Guided Learning Projects. With all of this combined, I demonstrate my understanding of the engineering design process and technical skills.
